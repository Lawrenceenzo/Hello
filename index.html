                        <strong>Dear Specific reader.</strong>
                        <p>
                            So the case is that abe provoked an unexpected event that I can’t control anymore. 
                            The way that this will go on two ways, and I would rather go to the path that I’m more likely to be hurt or in the other way around. I don’t think that every people that I met is not a total lost, but its a way of becoming more of my self, and to learn from my mistakes inm the past, to grow and achieve more goals that I have never done before. 
                            Break barriers that I didn’t know that I can break them. 

So who is this mysterious person that I’m talking about, and why did I got in this situation that I wouldn’t even expect that I would be in one. At first I didn’t even know who is “wendy” I stalked her a little bit and found out that abe and her are mutuals, and I didn’t know that they are even block mates, the rest is history.
